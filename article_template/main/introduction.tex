\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} original template is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8 and later \cite{IEEEhowto:IEEEtranpage}. Since this project is build from the IEEE-template which contains one ``Master'' \LaTeX-file, it has been found convenient to divide this template into sub-files. The 1\ts{st} semester paper template is build with the directories \texttt{main}, \texttt{set}, \texttt{sec}, \texttt{img} and \texttt{bibtex}. The \texttt{preamble.tex} has been cleaned from original comments and a few additional packages has been included. These changes are marked with comments inside the preamble. Feel free to ask any questions regarding this template, by email.

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is \ldots.
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo file is \ldots.
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is \ldots.
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a ``T'' for an initial drop letter
% and ``HIS'' in caps to complete the first word.
