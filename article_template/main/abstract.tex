        When studying M.Sc.EE. at Aalborg University it is required to hand in a scientific paper on the 1\ts{st} semester.
        Since this is the case, it is appropriatae to design a template for getting such a paper started. This is exactly what this document contains. The template is developed with purpose of focusing on studying more focused once the semester finally begins. By designing such a template now, the student will be able to focuse entirely on the mathematical subjects presented in lectures and in the consequential group work. In this paper, some random mathematical examples will be given, they are presented in a non-coherent context. Through examples, it is demonstrated that the sufficient packages is included in this project. Furthermore, this gives an indication of how the template looks and especially how math and tikz figures is presented. The code is available online.
