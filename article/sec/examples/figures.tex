\subsubsection{Figures}\label{sec:figures}.The handling of figures by means of plotting can be done in the usual way by importing the specified formats as figures inside the latex file. However, the approach in this template is to utilize tikz and pgfplots for plotting. Furthermore, a wrapper is attached to this template for utilizing the MATLAB library called \texttt{matlab2tikz}. \texttt{matlab2tikz} has the ability to convert a MATLAB figure into a tikz-file \cite{m2tikz}. It is possible to create the \LaTeX figure environment in a tex-file which inputs the generated tikz-figure. This can be done in one line from MATLAB, by using the file called \texttt{fig2tikz}\cite{fig2tikz}. \texttt{fig2tikz} creates a tikz-file and a tex-file with similar names. The tex-file is the only file that that needs to be input into \LaTeX by simply typing \texttt{\\input img/latexfile.tex}. A demo file which shows this procedure is attached to this project. The demo file is named \texttt{demofile\_m2t.m} and is placed in the root directory along with \texttt{fig2tikz.m}. All the figures in this paper is created by \texttt{demofile\_m2t.m}. Note that \texttt{matlab2tikz} has to be installed correctly for this procedure to work \cite{m2tikz}.
